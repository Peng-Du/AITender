# AITender

This project, **AITender**, automates the process of tender document management and analysis. It consists of the following key functionalities:

1.  **Automated Tender Document Download:** Automatically downloads tender PDF documents for a specified date from designated sources.
2.  **AI-Powered Document Analysis:** Converts the downloaded PDF documents into Markdown format, which are then processed by an AI Agent for in-depth analysis and summarization.
3.  **Summarization and Notification:** Aggregates the summaries generated by the AI Agent, compiles them into a user-friendly HTML file, and dispatches the summary via email for convenient review.
